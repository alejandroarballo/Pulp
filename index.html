            <h2>Early years: 1978-1983</h2>
            <p>Pulp were formed in 1978 at The City School in Sheffield by Jarvis Cocker, then 15 years old, and Peter
                Dalton, then 14. Cocker's original preference was to name the band after the film Pulp starring Michael
                Caine, though it was decided that this was too short. Instead, the two took inspiration from a copy of
                the Financial Times which listed the Arabicas coffee bean in its commodity index. Cocker and Dalton used
                this, with a slight spelling change, and the band became "Arabicus". Early rehearsals took place in
                Cocker's house and featured Cocker, Dalton and Dalton's younger brother Ian. After finally deciding on
                "Arabicus Pulp", a fixed line-up was then established: Cocker, Dalton and two friends of theirs, David
                "Fungus" Lockwood and Mark Swift. The band played their first public gig at Rotherham Arts Centre in
                July 1980. Later that year, Cocker met future member Russell Senior, who recognised Cocker from his
                charismatic sales techniques in his part-time job at the local fish market.
            <p>Their musical style at this time was varied, approximately described as "a cross between ABBA and The
                Fall". A local fanzine also noted this eclecticism, describing them as sounding "as if they listen to
                the John Peel show every night in an endless quest for influences". Indeed, in October 1981, they gave a
                demo tape to Peel, who granted them a Peel Session. The session was a giant leap forward for the young
                band, who became well known on the local music scene as a result. The tracks recorded were in the
                typical Sheffield sound of the time (cf. The Human League and Comsat Angels): electronic new wave and
                post-punk. These tracks were released in 2006 on The Peel Sessions compilation.</p>

            <h2>Independent days: 1984–1991</h2>
            <p>The new incarnation of Pulp survived a number of ill-fated gigs (including one at a rugby club at Brunel
                University which ended in a riot) before Allcard left to be replaced on keyboards by Magnus Doyle's
                sister Candida. Following her first performance with the band, they were signed to Fire Records. Soon
                after signing to Fire, in November 1985, Cocker fell out of a window while trying to impress a girl with
                a Spider-Man impression and ended up in hospital, temporarily requiring the use of a wheelchair in which
                he appeared during concerts. Pulp's relationship with Fire Records was tempestuous and Cocker admitted
                later that the band only accepted the deal as it "was the only offer on the table". During this period,
                the singles "Little Girl" and "Dogs Are Everywhere" were released.
            <p>Pulp's next major release was Freaks (1987), an album recorded in one week due to record label pressure.
                Cocker was irritated, and remarked that "the songs could've been done a lot better if we'd have had a
                bit more time...".The release of Freaks ended up being delayed for a year, and the record was not well
                received. The album's darker style may be considered the antithesis of the happy and optimistic It. When
                Freaks failed to be a success, Pulp recorded tracks with Chakk's label FON in Sheffield.A single called
                "Death Comes To Town" was due to be released by FON in early 1988, but this relationship disintegrated
                and the release was cancelled.It was during this time that Cocker was taking a part-time foundation
                course at Sheffield Polytechnic. This led to him leaving for London to study film at Central Saint
                Martins College of Art and Design, effectively folding the band.</p>

            <h2>Commercial height: 1992–1996</h2>
            <p>Pulp's repertoire was growing rapidly. Tracks such as "Babies", "Space" and "She's a Lady" were being
                played live throughout 1991 and in October of that year, they played their first overseas gig, a concert
                organised by French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. However, the band were still frustrated that
                Separations still had not seen a release and so Pulp left Fire and signed to Warp Records imprint Gift
                Records in 1992. Buoyed by a changing musical current, in June 1992 Pulp released "O.U." on Gift while
                Fire finally released Separations in the same month. Melody Maker made "O.U" a single of the week
                alongside "The Drowners" by Suede, a prominent new band. Pulp then signed to Island Records, who jointly
                released (with Gift) the singles "Babies" and "Razzmatazz" to increasing chart success. Next were the
                singles "Lipgloss" and their first top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, "Do You Remember the First
                Time?", which were put out as full Island releases. These singles were followed by the Ed
                Buller-produced album, His 'n' Hers (1994), which reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart and was
                nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.</p>

            <h2>Until break-up: 1997–2002</h2>
            <p>It was during this period of intense fame and tabloid scrutiny that longtime member and major innovator
                in the band's sound Russell Senior decided to leave the band, saying, "it wasn't creatively rewarding to
                be in Pulp anymore". The band were due to begin working on a new album in late 1996. However, Cocker was
                having difficulty with the celebrity lifestyle, battling cocaine addiction and a break-up of a long-term
                relationship. When the band came to begin work on the next album, they had only one song – "Help the
                Aged". This creative inertia meant the band took over a year to finish the next record. Indeed, it was
                Cocker's disillusionment with his long-desired wish for fame that made up much of the subject matter of
                This Is Hardcore, which was released in March 1998. The album took a darker and more challenging tone
                than that of Different Class and lyrical topics – pornography (the title track), fame ("Glory Days") and
                the after effects of drugs ("The Fear") – were dealt with more earnestly than on previous records. Also
                in 1998, Pulp collaborated with Patrick Doyle on the song "Like A Friend" for the soundtrack to the film
                Great Expectations. The song was also used in the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture Bros. season 4 finale
                "Operation: P.R.O.M."</p>
