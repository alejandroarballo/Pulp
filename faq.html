                <strong>Pulp's Identity</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>Pulp are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 1978. Their best-known line-up from their heyday
                (1992–1997) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin),
                Candida Doyle (keyboards), Nick Banks (drums, percussion), Steve Mackey (bass) and Mark Webber (guitar,
                keyboards). Throughout the 1980s the band struggled to find success, but gained prominence in the UK in
                the mid-1990s with the release of the albums His 'n' Hers in 1994 and particularly Different Class in
                1995, which reached the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. The album spawned four top ten singles,
                including "Common People" and "Sorted for E's & Wizz", both of which reached number two in the UK
                Singles Chart. Pulp's musical style during this period consisted of disco-influenced pop-rock coupled
                with references to British culture in their lyrics in the form of a "kitchen sink drama"-style. Cocker
                and the band became reluctant figureheads of the Britpop movement, and were nominated for the Mercury
                Music Prize in 1994 for His 'n' Hers; they won the prize in 1996 for Different Class and were nominated
                again in 1998 for This Is Hardcore. Pulp headlined the Pyramid Stage of the Glastonbury Festival twice
                and were regarded among the Britpop "big four", along with Oasis, Blur and Suede. The band released We
                Love Life in 2001 and then took a decade-long break, having sold more than 10 million records. Pulp
                reunited and played live again in 2011, with dates at the Isle of Wight Festival, Reading and Leeds
                Festivals, Pohoda, Sziget Festival, Primavera Sound, the Exit festival, and the Wireless Festival. A
                number of additional concert dates were afterward added to their schedule. In January 2013, Pulp
                released "After You", a song originally demoed for We Love Life, as a digital download single. It was
                the band's first single release since "Bad Cover Version" in 2002. On 9 March 2014, Pulp and filmmaker
                Florian Habicht premiered the feature documentary Pulp: A Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets at SXSW
                Music and Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The film toured the international film festival circuit and
                was released theatrically by Oscilloscope Laboratories in the US in November 2014. It is the first
                film about Pulp (and Sheffield) that has been made in collaboration with the band. The band once again
                went on hiatus following this, but in 2022, Cocker announced that the band would be reuniting for a
                second time to play a series of shows in 2023.</dd>

                <strong>Pulp's Name</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>Pulp were formed in 1978 at The City School in Sheffield by Jarvis Cocker, then 15 years old, and Peter
                Dalton, then 14. Cocker's original preference was to name the band after the film Pulp starring Michael
                Caine, though it was decided that this was too short. Instead, the two took inspiration from a copy of
                the Financial Times which listed the Arabicas coffee bean in its commodity index. Cocker and Dalton used
                this, with a slight spelling change, and the band became "Arabicus". Early rehearsals took place in
                Cocker's house and featured Cocker, Dalton and Dalton's younger brother Ian. After finally deciding on
                "Arabicus Pulp", a fixed line-up was then established: Cocker, Dalton and two friends of theirs, David
                "Fungus" Lockwood and Mark Swift.Their musical style at this time was varied, approximately described as
                "a cross between ABBA and The Fall". A local fanzine also noted this eclecticism, describing them as
                sounding "as if they listen to the John Peel show every night in an endless quest for influences".
                Indeed, in October 1981, they gave a demo tape to Peel, who granted them a Peel Session. The session
                was a giant leap forward for the young band, who became well known on the local music scene as a result.
                The tracks recorded were in the typical Sheffield sound of the time (cf. The Human League and Comsat
                Angels): electronic new wave and post-punk. These tracks were released in 2006 on The Peel Sessions
                compilation.</dd>

                <strong>Pulp's Biggest Songs</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>Pulp's repertoire was growing rapidly. Tracks such as "Babies", "Space" and "She's a Lady" were being
                played live throughout 1991 and in October of that year, they played their first overseas gig, a concert
                organised by French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. However, the band were still frustrated that
                Separations still had not seen a release and so Pulp left Fire and signed to Warp Records imprint Gift
                Records in 1992. Buoyed by a changing musical current, in June 1992 Pulp released "O.U." on Gift while
                Fire finally released Separations in the same month. Melody Maker made "O.U" a single of the week
                alongside "The Drowners" by Suede, a prominent new band. Pulp then signed to Island Records, who jointly
                released (with Gift) the singles "Babies" and "Razzmatazz" to increasing chart success. Next were the
                singles "Lipgloss" and their first top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, "Do You Remember the First
                Time?", which were put out as full Island releases. These singles were followed by the Ed
                Buller-produced album, His 'n' Hers (1994), which reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart and was
                nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. </dd>

                <strong>Peak Popularity</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>This sudden increase in popularity was helped by the massive media interest in Britpop alongside acts
                such as Suede, Oasis and Blur, with Pulp supporting the latter in a 1994 tour of the United States. 1995
                saw the peak of Pulp's fame, with the release of their number two single on the UK Singles Chart,
                "Common People", in May 1995 and their performance in June at the Glastonbury Festival (standing in
                for The Stone Roses at the last minute). A double A-side single, "Sorted for E's & Wizz/Mis-Shapes", was
                to precede the release of their next album, Different Class (1995). Upon the release of "Sorted for E's
                and Wizz", the Daily Mirror printed a front-page story headed "BAN THIS SICK STUNT" alongside a story by
                Kate Thornton which said the song was "pro-drugs" and called for the single to be banned. The single
                had an inlay which showed how to conceal amphetamines in a DIY 'wrap'. Cocker released a statement two
                days later saying: "...'Sorted' is not a pro-drugs song. Nowhere on the sleeve does it say you are
                supposed to put drugs in here but I understand the confusion. I don't think anyone who listens to
                'Sorted' would come away thinking it had a pro-drugs message." The single reached number two on the UK
                Singles Charts. Released in October 1995, Different Class garnered significant critical praise and
                debuted at the top of the UK Album Chart. This was the first album featuring Pulp fan-club president
                Mark Webber, who became a permanent member of the band on guitar and keyboards. The album followed
                similar themes to their previous work with observations of life expressed through Cocker's sexualised,
                sometimes dark and witty lyrics. Other singles released from Different Class were "Disco 2000" and
                "Something Changed", which reached numbers seven and ten respectively in the UK. In September 1996,
                Different Class won the Mercury Music Prize. It was at this time that Cocker gained significant media
                exposure due to a notorious prank at the 1996 BRIT Awards, where he invaded the stage in protest during
                pop singer Michael Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" and "wiggled his backside" at the audience.
                After complaints by Jackson and his entourage, Cocker spent the night in Kensington Police Station
                charged with actual bodily harm and assaulting the child performers. However, with British comedian and
                former solicitor Bob Mortimer acting as legal representation, he was released without charge. This
                incident propelled Cocker into great controversy in the UK and elsewhere, and Pulp's record sales soared
                as a result. The event also coincided with the beginning of their first arena tour and the Daily Mirror,
                who had attacked the band months earlier, set up a "Justice for Jarvis" campaign backing his actions and
                carried out a stunt at Pulp's Sheffield Arena gig on 29 February, handing out free T-shirts. The NME
                described Cocker's actions as a "great publicity stunt" which was "creative, subversive and very, very
                funny", while Melody Maker described Cocker as, "arguably the Fifth Most Famous Man in Britain"
                and suggested he should be knighted.</dd>

                <strong> Pulp's Break Up</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>It was during this period of intense fame and tabloid scrutiny that longtime member and major innovator
                in the band's sound Russell Senior decided to leave the band, saying, "it wasn't creatively rewarding to
                be in Pulp anymore". The band were due to begin working on a new album in late 1996. However, Cocker
                was having difficulty with the celebrity lifestyle, battling cocaine addiction and a break-up of a
                long-term relationship. When the band came to begin work on the next album, they had only one song –
                "Help the Aged". This creative inertia meant the band took over a year to finish the next record.
                Indeed, it was Cocker's disillusionment with his long-desired wish for fame that made up much of the
                subject matter of This Is Hardcore, which was released in March 1998. The album took a darker and more
                challenging tone than that of Different Class and lyrical topics – pornography (the title track), fame
                ("Glory Days") and the after effects of drugs ("The Fear") – were dealt with more earnestly than on
                previous records. Also in 1998, Pulp collaborated with Patrick Doyle on the song "Like A Friend" for the
                soundtrack to the film Great Expectations. The song was also used in the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture
                Bros. season 4 finale "Operation: P.R.O.M."</dd>

                <strong>After the Break Up</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>Cocker was involved in a number of one-offs and side projects, including the group Relaxed Muscle with
                Jason Buckle and the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where he fronted a group which included
                Steve Mackey and members of Radiohead. In 2006 he collaborated with Air, Neil Hannon and Charlotte
                Gainsbourg on her album entitled 5:55. In 2007 he appeared on Air's album Pocket Symphony, co-writing
                and giving vocals to the tracks "One Hell of a Party" and "The Duelist". His first solo album, Jarvis,
                with the participation of Mackey, was released to critical acclaim in November 2006. Candida Doyle has
                performed live with Cocker on his solo tours. Mackey produced tracks on the debut album by M.I.A.,
                Arular, and on Someone To Drive You Home by the Long Blondes, both of which were critically well
                received. He has also produced tracks for Bromheads Jacket and Florence + The Machine. On 11 September
                2006 the band re-released three of their albums (His 'n' Hers, Different Class, and This Is Hardcore),
                each with a bonus disc of B-sides, demos and rarities. On 23 October 2006 a 2-CD set compiling all of
                Pulp's John Peel Sessions from 1982 to 2001 was released.</dd>

                <strong>Reunion</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>In November 2010 it was announced that the Different Class line-up (Cocker, Banks, Doyle, Mackey, Senior
                and Webber) would be playing at the Wireless festival in London's Hyde Park and a Saturday slot at the
                Isle of Wight Festival in 2011. In a message sent to the band's official mailing list on 1 January
                2011, Cocker said the large amount of interest in the band's reunion had been "an inspiration," and that
                he was pleased with how rehearsals were going. Bassist Steve Mackey performing with Pulp at On the
                Bright Side in Perth in 2011. The band announced 22 concerts between May and September 2011, taking
                place in Europe and Australia. Pulp were one of the surprise special guests at Glastonbury Festival
                2011 in June where they played on The Park stage on Saturday evening. They performed at the
                Sziget Festival in Hungary on 10 August, Way Out West Festival in Sweden on 13 August, and played as
                co-headliners to The Strokes at the Reading Festival and the Leeds Festival during the final weekend of
                August 2011. They headlined the Electric Picnic on 4 September, their last festival of the year. On 9
                January 2012, the Coachella festival line-up was released, with Pulp listed as part of the line-up.
                Further dates were announced, including North and South America and a concert at the Royal Albert Hall
                in support of the Teenage Cancer Trust. Senior did not take part in the 2012 gigs. In February 2012,
                It, Freaks and Separations (the albums released by Fire Records) were re-issued. These
                editions came with bonus tracks, including "Death Goes to the Disco", "Dogs Are Everywhere" and "Sink or
                Swim". Cocker told ShortList magazine in April 2012 that he was working on ideas for new Pulp songs,
                but in November he told Q that the band had no plans to release new material and would be "cruising off
                into the sunset" at the end of the year, signalling a possible end to the reunion. The band played a
                one-off concert in their hometown of Sheffield in December that year, at the 13,500 capacity Motorpoint
                Arena and made a previously unreleased track, "After You", available for download to those who had
                attended the concert. It was subsequently released to the general public in January 2013 via digital
                download. The song had previously only existed in demo form. Their last performance was to promote
                the song on The Jonathan Ross Show on 9 February 2013. The remixed version of "After You" by Soulwax
                later went on to be used in the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V as a track on the ingame radio
                station, Soulwax FM.</dd>

                <strong>Most Recent Reunion</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>In July 2022, following speculation from a cryptic Instagram post, Cocker announced that the band would
                reunite for a series of concerts in 2023. Nick Banks also tweeted confirming the announcement by
                saying "Hey folks, unsurprisingly it’s has all gone a bit mental on here. Gig details will be revealed
                as and when. Stay calm, hug your #pulp records and dream of going mental sometime in 2023." Cocker
                has also appeared at a concert with Richard Hawley (former touring guitarist of first reunion),
                speculating his involvement in the reunion. The reunion was confirmed on 28th October 2022, with dates
                announced at Finsbury Park, TRNSMT, Latitude Festival as well as 2 homecoming shows at Sheffield Arena.
                Former Pulp bassist, Steve Mackey announced on his Instagram that he would not be taking part but stated
                "Wishing Candy, Nick, Mark and Jarvis the very best with forthcoming performances in the UK and also an
                enormous thanks to Pulp’s amazing fanbase, many of whom have sent me lovely messages today".</dd>
